[Cisco Packet Tracer]

This repository contains networking labs and simulations created using Cisco Packet Tracer.
It is intended for learning and practicing computer networking concepts such as switching, routing, and network protocols.

Contents
Basic Networking – IP addressing, ping tests, simple topologies
Switching – VLANs, trunking, inter-VLAN routing
Routing – Static routing, RIP, OSPF, EIGRP
Services – DHCP, DNS, HTTP, FTP simulations
Advanced Labs – WAN connections, ACLs, NAT, etc

Purpose
For practice while studying networking (e.g., CCNA preparation).
For learning networking fundamentals.
As examples of common network configurations.

## Project Overview
- **Star Topology**
  - A central hub (or switch) connects all nodes.
  - Simple to configure and troubleshoot.
  - Failure of a single peripheral node does not affect the network, but failure of the central hub can bring down the network.
- **Mesh Topology**
  - Every node is connected to every other node.
  - Provides high redundancy and reliability.
  - Can handle multiple failures without network downtime.
  - More complex to configure and maintain due to multiple connections.

## Files Included
- `Cisco Packet Tracker.pkt` – The Packet Tracer file containing the network simulations for both topologies.

## How to Use
1. Open **Cisco Packet Tracker**.
2. Load the file `Cisco Packet Tracker.pkt`.
3. Explore the **Star topology** and **Mesh topology** configurations.
4. Test connectivity between nodes using pings or simulation mode.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding basic network topologies and their applications.
- Hands-on experience with Cisco Packet Tracker.
- Learn how different topologies affect network reliability, maintenance, and scalability.
